    Hi! My name is Niko, and this is my website! All of my work and projects
    will be available through here, so feel free to look around!

  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>
    I love all things tech and nerdy. I am interested in mainly the software
    side of technology, and I love to learn new skills and abilites. I love to
    create art, mostly digital. I use both Krita on my PC and Procreate on my
    iPad to create. I also occasionally make music, using BandLab or Garageband.
    I played an instrument called a viola for 5 years, and I was part of an
    orchestra that attended concerts. In my free time I enjoy playing a huge
    varity of video games, or sitting down with a good book.
